## Problem
We wanted to create an application that helps people find inspiriation on the latest in movies, music, and video games according to their peers. 

## Solution
We made an application that enables the user to create posts by category, asking for advice on media to seek out, or making suggestions for others. Each post is stored through Firebase, organized according to category. Using the Firebase generated ID, the post is referenced so that other users can leave comments and replies, creating a thread on a given topic. Users can also "like" a post
